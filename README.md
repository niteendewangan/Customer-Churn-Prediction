🚀 **Customer Churn Prediction using Logistic Regression**

Just completed a data science project focused on predicting whether a customer will stop using a service.

🔹 **Objective:** Identify at-risk customers using machine learning
🔹 **Approach:** Data cleaning → Encoding → Logistic Regression → ROC Curve
🔹 **Outcome:** Achieved an accuracy of **81.47%** and strong insights into churn behavior

🧠 **Tech Stack:** Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

This project strengthened my understanding of **classification models**, **data preprocessing**, and **model evaluation metrics**.

📊 Visualized results using confusion matrix & ROC curve for better interpretability.
